# Energy Consumption - Exploratory Clustering

This is an **exploratory clustering** study to group households by energy consumption behavior.
The goal is to understand broad usage patterns that can support tariffs, energy-saving actions,
and demand-response programs.

## Why clustering?
- There are no labels, so clustering helps discover hidden patterns.
- It creates simple segments for targeted communication.
- It helps generate hypotheses for deeper analysis later.

## What is included
- One notebook with a linear, easy-to-follow workflow.
- Basic EDA and a simple clustering model.
- A short summary of clusters for business interpretation.
